# RLPlayground
## To Run
for running a single algorithm on a particular environment. (Just vpg & simple_pg are available to run, for both kind of environments: discrete and continuous)
```
python main.py --config configs/vpg_cont_config.yaml
```
## Experiments
Working on comparison among algorithms and their configurations.
